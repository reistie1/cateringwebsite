This is a catering website I made to showcase my skills as a web developer. I wanted to focus on the HMTL and CSS part of the pjoect to get the layout and look of the pages right and responsive as well as being consistant between all browsers and versions. Javascript was used to add some interactivity with the menu navigation, the navigation between gallery images in the modal and rotating through the carousel images on the index page. The website was developed on a MAMP local server. The javascript functions were tested using Jest for its simplicity, since I was only able to test the important functions and not the the event listeners themselves. Finally, I used a dash of PHP for server side validation of the contact form and to send emails requesting more information about services, menu options and general questions.
